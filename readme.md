# QT_QML_PROJECTS

This repository contains a collection of Qt/QML projects, each housed in its own directory. The purpose of this repo is to showcase various GUI applications built using Qt and QML, demonstrating different functionalities and designs. Each project directory includes source files, resources, and build configurations, with a demo GIF for each project stored in the `projects_GIF` directory.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
- **projectX/**: Directory for each project, containing source files (`main.cpp`, QML files), resources (e.g., images), and build files (e.g., `CMakeLists.txt`).
- **projects_GIF/**: Directory containing GIFs demonstrating each project's functionality.
